                        <p>In the spirit of giving back to the community, Umuringa Fashion code offers training to young people who are interested in art and design. We inspire youth to be proactive, problem solvers, self-reliant, and big thinkers. </p>
                        <p>
                            We teach our students creativity and innovation on how to use available resources, for instance, fabricating artistic skin made bags and footwear. That way, we train a generation of job providers, contributing significantly to the sustainable development of Rwanda.
